# MacOs-Gestures-on-KDE-Kubuntu
libinput gestures config for almost close to MacOS gestures. Built this cause I switched from a Mac to a normal laptop

### How To Setup

- Install libinput-gestures from https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures
- Copy File `libinput-gestures.conf` from repository to ~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf
- Run ```libinput-gestures-setup restart```
- And you're good to go!

PSA: This works only with KDE environment with additional global shortcuts set for switching activities/virtual desktops!
